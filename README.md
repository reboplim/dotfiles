# dotfiles

My configuration files.

## Getting Started

These dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://gnu.org/software/stow). The top-level directories are referred to by `stow` as "packages".

To install a package (e.g. the `bash` package), run the following command:

```
stow bash
```

For more information, consider reading the [GNU Stow manual](https://gnu.org/software/stow/manual).
